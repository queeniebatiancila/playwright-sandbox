# üé≠ Playwright Sandbox

This is a personal repository for learning and practicing automated tests using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)‚Äîa powerful end-to-end testing framework for web applications. This serves as my learning ground to build hands-on experience with browser automation, test structuring, and real-world testing scenarios. 

## üöÄ What's Inside

This project includes small demos and exercises that showcase:

- UI interaction automation (clicks, forms, navigation)
- Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Mobile emulation and viewport testing
- Page Object Model (POM) structure
- Handling waits and timeouts
- Screenshots and trace recording
- File uploads/downloads
- Test reports with Playwright's built-in reporter
